# Chess-starter-project

# 11/6 - Starter project is up, I put together 2 scripts, MoveSelector.cs and TileSelector.cs, 
# which are not totally complete yet, refer to the link in the GroupMe to finish up the code for those scripts.
# So far, we can highlight and move pieces - they just aren't lega; moves yet.
